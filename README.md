# SDPROM - Specification Driven Predictive Process Monitoring Tool

**Predictive business process monitoring** aims at forecasting the future information of a running business process based on the models extracted from business process execution logs (event logs). This tool, which is called **SDPROM**, is a prototype that implements the Specification-Driven Predictive Process Monitoring approach introduced in [1, [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00617)]. It is a [ProM](http://promtools.org) plug-in, and it enables us to
* specify the desired prediction tasks using the language that is introduced in [1, [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00617)], and
* create the corresponding prediction models based on the given specification.

Once the prediction models has been created, they can be used to provide predictive analysis service in business process monitoring. The [screencast](http://bit.ly/sdprom-screencast) of this tool, which explains the way how to use our tool ([ProM](http://promtools.org) plug-in), can be found in http://bit.ly/sdprom-screencast. The user manual  of our tools (including the instructions on how to reproduce our experiments) can be found in http://bit.ly/sdprom-manual. The binary distribution (.jar) of this tool can be found in http://bit.ly/sdprom-dist. More information about this work can be found in [1, [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00617)] and http://bit.ly/predictive-analysis.

## Compiling and Building the Project.

This project is a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) project. Thus, compiling and building the release binaries can be done using maven in the usual way. Currently we use Maven 3 and Java 8 to build the project.
